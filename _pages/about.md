I'm a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Applied Physics at Stanford University, working with [Hideo Mabuchi](https://www.mabuchilab.org) to figure out how we can make simple things behave and compute in interesting and useful ways by having many of them interact. Our simple things of choice are usually light pulses in nonlinear crystals, but after some abstraction the equations can describe a variety of dynamical systems with high-dimensional state spaces. Random matrices and dynamical mean fields have a tendency of rearing their distributions in this work. Details forthcomingâ€”watch this space.

Off the clock I try to do my little part to find out what I and my communities can do to stop shoving carbon from the lithosphere into the atmosphere at such a breakneck rate, because right now the future isn't looking so bright: <https://doi.org/10.1093/biosci/biz088>.
